This site is built with Jekyll - Quickstart is here: 
https://jekyllrb.com/docs/

```
bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental
```
Incremental is optional, but useful. It will regenerate the site on localhost for page-level changes, but changes to _config.yml or the files in _data/ will require a restart.
